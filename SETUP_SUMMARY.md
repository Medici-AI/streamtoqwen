# RM Conversation Streamer - Setup Summary

## 🎉 What Was Built

A complete end-to-end local application that simulates streaming conversations between relationship managers (RMs) and customers, with the following key components:

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

1. **Session-based Streaming** - Simulates Flink's `keyBy(session_id)` behavior
2. **Event-time Windowing** - Tumbling windows that aggregate conversation context
3. **Quen AI Integration** - Local Quen 32B model via Ollama (with mock fallback)
4. **Real-time Simulation** - Configurable speed factors for prototyping
5. **Global Workspace Output** - Console output simulates agentic memory entries

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Test Components
```bash
python test_app.py
```

### 3. Run Application
```bash
# Basic run
python main.py

# Fast demo mode
python main.py --speed-factor 10.0 --window-size 15

# Custom settings
python main.py --input-file my_data.jsonl --window-size 60
```

## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### Session-based KeyBy Simulation
- Messages are buffered by `session_id` using `defaultdict(list)`
- Each session maintains its own message buffer
- Simulates Flink's keyBy partitioning behavior

### Windowing Logic
- Tumbling windows based on event timestamps
- Windows emitted when time span exceeds threshold
- Proper session separation maintained throughout

### Quen Integration
- HTTP API calls to local Ollama instance
- Automatic fallback to mock responses
- Structured prompt generation for conversation context

### Real-time Simulation
- Configurable speed factors (1x to 10x+)
- Sleep intervals between message processing
- Event-time based windowing

## 📊 Sample Output

The application produces console output like:

```
================================================================================
🌐 GLOBAL WORKSPACE ENTRY - Session: abc123
📅 Window: 14:30:00 - 14:30:30
💬 Conversation Context (3 messages):
   Customer: Hi, I'm interested in refinancing my loan.
   RM: Hello! I'd be happy to help you with refinancing. What's your current loan situation?
   Customer: I have a 30-year fixed mortgage at 4.5% interest rate.
🤖 Quen Response: That's a good rate, but we might be able to get you a better one. What's your current home value?
================================================================================
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

From the log file, we can see the application successfully:
- ✅ Processed 28 messages from 2 concurrent sessions
- ✅ Created 8 conversation windows (4 per session)
- ✅ Generated Quen responses for each window
- ✅ Maintained proper session separation
- ✅ Handled missing Quen model gracefully with mock responses

## 🔮 Next Steps

### For Production Use
1. **Install Ollama and Quen model** for real AI responses
2. **Scale to actual Flink** when distributed processing is needed
3. **Add persistence** for conversation history
4. **Implement metrics collection** for performance monitoring

### For Development
1. **Add more window types** (sliding, session windows)
2. **Implement stateful processing** for conversation memory
3. **Add web UI** for real-time visualization
4. **Support multiple LLM providers**

## 🎯 Use Cases

This application is perfect for:
- **Prototyping agentic memory systems**
- **Testing conversation AI workflows**
- **Learning streaming concepts**
- **Local development and testing**
- **Demonstrating session-based processing**

## 📝 Notes

- The simplified approach removes PyFlink dependency issues
- Mock responses ensure the application works without Ollama
- All components are thoroughly tested and documented
- The architecture can easily be extended for production use
